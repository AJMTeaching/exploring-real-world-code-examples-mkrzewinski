import datetime
import time

def set_alarm(alarm_time):
    while True:
        current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
        
        if current_time == alarm_time:
            print("Wake up! It's time for your alarm.")
            # You can add code here to play a sound or perform any other action
            break
        
        time.sleep(1)  # Check the time every second

# Set the alarm time in HH:MM:SS format
alarm_time = "07:00:00"
set_alarm(alarm_time)

why? lines 14 & 15 indicate that the operating system will sound the alarm when the current time is equal to the alarm time and display the message "Wake up! It's time for your alarm."
